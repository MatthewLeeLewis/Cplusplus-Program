# Cplusplus-Program

*----Summarize the project and what problem it was solving----*
  This project allowed me to show that I could work between two different programming languages simultaneously (Python and C++) by integrating them together in a single project using C++ for the interface and Python for reading and writing data, using text files to store data. In this project, simple grocery item calculations are made.


*----What did you do particularly well?----*
  I would say I formatted my code and organized everything particularly well.


*----Where could you enhance your code? How could these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?----*
  The code could be enhance to be a much more cohesive grocery cart system, allowing us to add items to available inventory, remove them, etc. The interface could also be fleshed out with graphics or at least colored text, which I did not end up having time to implement.


*----Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?----*
  It's difficult to pinpoint the most difficult part. I suppose the most difficult would honestly be the overall structure of the code in general. Once I figured out how and where each part would be coded, coding it wasn't too complicated. I occasionally had to remember a few functions and rules but simple research in zyBooks and Google always helped that pretty quickly.
  
  
*----What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?----*
  Definitely the integration of two languages. This project helped me better understand how to do this, and that is a highly transferrable skill.
  
  
*----How did you make this program maintanable, readable, and adaptable?----*
  By the use of whitespace, functions and methods, and in-line comments. Those three things together really helped to make everything clear.
